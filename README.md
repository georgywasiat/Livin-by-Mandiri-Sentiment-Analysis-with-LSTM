# Livin' by Mandiri Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

In this study, I conducted sentiment analysis of the reviews of the Livin' by Mandiri application available on the Google Play Store. Data was collected for the period from January 1st to January 10th, 2024, using the Instant Data Scraper technique on the Google Chrome browser. The aim of this analysis is to understand users' perceptions of the Livin' by Mandiri application, which is one of the leading digital banking applications. To achieve this goal, I applied the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in natural language processing, specifically for sentiment analysis tasks. LSTM was chosen due to its superior ability to handle long-range dependencies in text, which is crucial in understanding context and nuances in user reviews. The results of this analysis are expected to provide valuable insights for Bank Mandiri in understanding user needs and feedback, as well as informing further application development strategies. This research also aims to demonstrate the practical application of natural language processing technology in the world of digital banking.
